For `Option`, we again consider both cases `None` and `Some` and expand the equation.
The monadic `unit` is the `Some(_)` constructor.

Left identity is trivially true for None:
```scala
None.flatMap(Some(_)) == None
```

And here it is for Some:
```scala
Some(v).flatMap(Some(_)) == Some(v)
```

Substitute the definition of `flatMap`:
```scala
Some(v) == Some(v)
```

Right identity is just as easy for None:
```scala
Some(None).flatMap(f) == f(None)
```

Substitute definition of flatMap:
```scala
f(None) == f(None)
```

And for Some:
```scala
Some(Some(v)).flatMap(f) == f(Some(v))
```

Substitute definition of flatMap:
```scala
f(Some(v)) == f(Some(v))
```
